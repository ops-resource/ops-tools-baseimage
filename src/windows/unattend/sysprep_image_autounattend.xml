        This file describes the different configuration phases for a windows machine.

    <!--
         Many aspects of the installation process can be automated during the windowsPE configuration pass. In this pass you can configure:
         * Windows PE options: These options can include specifying the location of the Windows PE log file, which enables networking or a
           Windows PE page file.

         * Windows Setup options: These options can include specifying the Windows image to install and configuring a disk on the destination computer.

        During this configuration pass, the Windows image is copied to the destination computer after the settings in the windowsPE configuration pass
        are processed.

        If your installation of Windows PE requires boot-critical drivers to access the local hard disk drive or a network, use this configuration pass
        to add drivers to the Windows PE driver store and to reflect the required boot-critical drivers
    -->

    <!--
         During this configuration pass, computer-specific information is removed from the Windows installation enabling you to
         capture and reapply the Windows image to different computers. For example, during this pass, the unique security ID (SID),
         unique device drivers, and other hardware-specific settings are removed from the image.

        This configuration pass enables you to minimally configure the sysprep /generalize command, in addition to configuring other Windows
        settings that must persist on your master image.

        After the generalize pass finishes, the next time that Windows image boots, the specialize configuration pass runs. If you want to
        retain the unique device drivers that are installed to your Windows installation, you can use the
        Microsoft-Windows-PnpSysprep | PersistAllDeviceInstalls setting. If this setting is configured, unique device drivers are not
        removed from the installation.

         This configuration pass is used to create and configure information in the Windows image, and is specific to the hardware that the
         Windows image is installing to.

        After the Windows image boots for the first time, the specialize configuration pass runs. During this pass, unique security IDs (SIDs)
        are created. Additionally, you can configure many Windows features, including network settings, international settings, and domain information.
        The answer file settings for the specialize pass appear in audit mode. When a computer boots to audit mode, the auditSystem pass runs, and
        the computer processes the auditUser settings.

    <!--
        During this configuration pass, settings are applied to Windows before Windows Welcome starts.
        This pass is typically used to configure Windows Shell options, create user accounts, and specify language and
        locale settings. The answer file settings for the oobeSystem pass appear in Windows Welcome, also known as OOBE.
